## Title : Energy Efficient Routing Algorithm With Mobile Sink Support for Wireless sensor networks

## objectives

1. average energy cosumption
2. More network life time
3. Should have higher throughput,low latency

## Tool
MAT lab

### Algorithm
Energy efficient routing algorithm

### Protocol
LEACH-Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy

## Steps to execute the Project

1. Install Matlab tool or If there is no license version use online matlab with free trail.

2. Create a folder with files and open in MATlab.

3. Open LEACH.m in text editor and run the file.

4. A plot will be displayed containing sensor nodes placed randomly. 

5. The static nodes are normal sensor nodes sending data and moving star node is mobile sink.

6. The data path between cluster head to member nodes are represented by blue and from cluster head to sink are black.

7. After all rounds the dead nodes created in red color.

8. After specific round in command window, Stop the execution by entering Ctrl+c.

9. In workspace at last there will be a table named tbl.

10. Open that table and we can see there the properties of all sensor nodes like CH, Residual energy, D2CH, D2Sink.
